# First-Programs
A collection of the very first programs I typed into Python.  Everybody has to start somewhere, and this is where I started. 
NONE of the code is original or something that I created.  I was just learining at this point.  I wanted to put these here in order to learn how to use GitHub and to show my future self where I started.
